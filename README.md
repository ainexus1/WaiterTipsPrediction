**Project Title**: Waiter Tip Prediction

**Description**:

Welcome to the Waiter Tip Prediction project! This machine learning project focuses on predicting tips that waiters are likely to receive based on various factors such as the total bill, customer's gender, smoking preference, day of the week, meal time, and party size. Predicting tips accurately can be beneficial for both waitstaff and restaurant owners to optimize service and revenue.

**Key Features**:
- Utilizes a Linear Regression model to make tip predictions.
- Dataset sourced from real-world restaurant transactions.
- Preprocesses and cleans the data to handle missing values and categorical variables.
- Offers the flexibility to input custom values for prediction.

**How to Use**:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
3. Follow the provided code comments for guidance on loading and preprocessing data.
4. Use the trained model to make tip predictions by providing relevant input values.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to the project. We hope this project proves valuable in understanding and improving tip prediction accuracy for the restaurant industry.

Happy predicting! üçΩÔ∏èüí∞
